# Portfolio

## Summary

#### This project is a portfolio web app built to practice html, css, and JS/jQuery. The site contains recent work, an about section, and a contact section. The portfolio was built based off an existing portfolio I had made in the past using Squarespace.

- Being more efficient orienting content around the page using CSS

## Unsolved Challenges

- Creating a responsive hamburger menu for mobile version from scratch (without using frameworks)
